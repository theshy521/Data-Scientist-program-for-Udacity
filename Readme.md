# Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post
The purpose of this project is showing off technical skills, but more importantly to begin putting together a portfolio that shows ability to effectively communicate technical results.

For this project, I will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio. 

Here is an overview of the main steps in this project, following the CRISP-DM process:

Come up with three questions that interested in answering.
Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
Evaluate results.
Share insights with stakeholders in a blog post.


# Data Source
I used data from Kaggleâ€™s Airbnb Seattle and Boston data.

Seattle Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.
Boston Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA.

## Step 1 : Exploration Data Analysis
Data loading, data process for miss values



## Step 2 : Concat Seattle and Boston data
Concat Seattle and Boston data for further analysis



## Step 3 : Come up with three questions that interested in answering.
1. Analyze property_type for seattle and boston
2. Analyze probalibity distribution of Price
3. Analyze correlation between numerical columuns and price. And train customed AI model to predict price.
